 * Medium 162. Find Peak Element
 * <p>
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 * <p>

 * Medium 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array
 * <p>
 * An array arr a mountain if the following properties hold:
 * arr.length >= 3
 * There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
 * arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
 * arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
 * Given a mountain array arr, return the index i such that arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].
 * <p>
 * Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
 * Output: 1
